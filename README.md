Code for application isn't available publicly as the application is being used by Swati Corporation. 

I have attachted images of the application before completing development as after development is a security risk.

# Login Screen:

When user enters detail and clicks on login, an API call is sent to Google Firebase with details for authentication. 
If details are correct it redirects it to email verification page and if the account is already verified it opens the Home page.
